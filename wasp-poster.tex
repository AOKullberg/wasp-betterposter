% This Latex poster uses the baposter class, originally from
% http://www.brian-amberg.de/uni/poster. Versions are found in several places.
% The files on which this version is based are from circulation within WASP
% and exact origins are not known.
%
% CONTENT
% To update the poster, modify the contents in the parts/ folder.
% The file header.tex contains convenience commands such as \title, \companylogo etc.
% Other files contain pure formatting.
%
% COLORS
% The following standard colors are defined: wasp_text, wasppink, waspgrey, waspblue
%
% Enjoy!
% Per Skarin, 2021
% 
% This template is based on the wasp poster template but adjusted to be a "betterposter" ish design.
% Should work out of the box, but just like the wasp poster template it is riddled with bugs and hardcoding. Deal with it.

    Put your main finding here, in CLEAR and PLAIN English. Remember to \textbf{emphasize} the \textbf{important} words! The default size is perfect for 2-4 lines of text, no more. Actually, it shouldn't be more anyway.
